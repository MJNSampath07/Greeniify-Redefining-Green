# Greeniify-Redefining-Green
Waste management is a pressing environmental and social issue that requires innovative solutions. In this project, we propose a novel approach to transform waste into valuable products and sell them through an online platform called Greeniify â€“ Redefining Green.
Greeniify is a website that connects waste producers, such as households and businesses, with waste converters, who are entrepreneurs or organizations that can create useful products from waste materials. The products range from compost and fertilizer to handicrafts and furniture. Greeniify aims to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, incinerators or oceans, while generating income and employment opportunities for waste converters. The website also promotes environmental awareness and education among its users and customers. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of Greeniify, as well as the results of a pilot study that evaluated its feasibility and impact. We conclude that Greeniify is a promising solution to address the challenges of waste management and contribute to the circular economy.
